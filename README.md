## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Modern web browser
- (Optional) Google Gemini AI API key

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MemberCommons
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp config/settings.example.js config/settings.js
   # Edit config/settings.js with your API keys and database settings
   ```

3. **Set up database**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb ModelEarthDB
   
   # Run schema setup
   psql membercommons < sql/suitecrm-postgres.sql
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

COMMONS_HOST in .env file

5. **Initialize database schema**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- init-db
   ```


6. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- serve
   ```
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or include the port by running:

   ```bash
      SERVER_PORT=8081 cargo run -- serve
   ```

### Frontend Setup

We recommend skipping 1 and open a server in your webroot instead.

1. **Serve the frontend**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Simple HTTP server
   python -m http.server 3000
   
   # Option 2: Node.js serve
   npx serve .
   
   # Option 3: PHP server
   php -S localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

&nbsp; &nbsp; Or (recommended) open your webroot folder after running in your webroot (parent of membercommons folder):
   ```
   python -m http.server 8887
   ```
   
Then view here when coding (hit refresh after changing with an AI CLI above):

[http://localhost:8887/membercommons](http://localhost:8887/membercommons)


## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration
Update the API base URL in your frontend:
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8081/api';
```

### Database Configuration
The application supports Azure and Google Cloud PostgreSQL:
```rust
// In Cargo.toml or environment variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sqladmin@model-earth-server.database.windows.net/ModelEarthDB
```

### Authentication Providers
Configure OAuth providers in `config/settings.js`:
- Google OAuth 2.0
- GitHub OAuth
- LinkedIn OAuth
- Email/password authentication
