# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
- `cargo build` - Build the project
- `cargo run -- serve` - Start the REST API server  
- `cargo run -- init-db` - Initialize database schema
- `cargo check` - Check code without building
- `cargo clippy` - Run linting
- `cargo test` - Run tests

### Development Mode
- Server host/port configurable via `SERVER_HOST`/`SERVER_PORT` environment variables
- **IMPORTANT**: Never use `cargo run serve` alone - it blocks the terminal and stops when you exit

### Background Development Server (ALWAYS USE THIS)
```bash
# ALWAYS use this command to start server - keeps running in background
nohup cargo run serve > server.log 2>&1 &

# Check if dev server is running
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health

# Stop dev background server
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
```

### Alternative Commands (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- `cargo run serve` - Blocks terminal, stops when you exit (DO NOT USE)
- `cargo run -- serve` - Same issue, blocks terminal (DO NOT USE)

## Project Vision & Requirements

This is a **project posting, assignment and to-do tracking system** - an all-in-one partner tool for managing public-facing listings with searchable directories. The system enables collaboration between teams, organizations and clients to share opportunities, handle proposals, assign projects, track progress, and manage invoices.

### Target Audience
Technical coders and programmers who deploy AI to streamline government processes while providing real-time mentoring at local projects funded by Innovation Bonds.

### Core Features Required
1. **Project Management**: Post activities, join projects, track progress
2. **Team Collaboration**: Account-based teams and organizations  
3. **Directory System**: Searchable public listings with pagination
4. **Survey System**: Policy preferences and interests with 5-star ratings
5. **Auth Integration**: Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, email login + Admin Demo bypass
6. **Gemini AI Integration**: Smart insights and natural language search

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (Rust)
- **REST API Server**: Actix-web based HTTP server at `src/main.rs`
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL using SQLx with async connection pooling
- **CLI Interface**: Clap-based command structure with `serve` and `init-db` subcommands
- **AI Integration**: Uses `gemini_client_rust` for Google Gemini API

### Frontend (JAM Stack JavaScript)
- **Design Philosophy**: Notion-inspired aesthetic - modular, calm, ultra-minimal
- **Color Palette**: Light green, pastel blue, muted orange accents on neutral background (#F9FAFB)
- **Navigation**: Collapsible left sidebar with smooth animations
- **Routing**: HashRouter for static compatibility with deep linking support
- **No Build Required**: Frontend works directly without compilation
- **Favicon**: All HTML pages should include favicon with relative path to `img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png`

#### Favicon Implementation
All HTML pages should include this favicon tag in the `<head>` section:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="[relative-path]/img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png">
```

**Relative Path Examples:**
- Root level pages: `href="img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png"`
- Admin pages: `href="../img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png"`
- Nested admin pages: `href="../../img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png"`
- Deep nested pages: `href="../../../img/logo/neighborhood/favicon.png"`

### HashRouter Implementation
The application implements a sophisticated HashRouter system that enables:
- **Deep Linking**: Direct navigation to any section/tab via URL hash
- **Parameter Preservation**: URL parameters persist across navigation changes
- **State Management**: Automatic UI updates based on URL changes
- **Filter Integration**: Search terms, city filters, and project filters are reflected in URL

#### URL Structure
```
#section/tab?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

#### Examples
- `#home/welcome` - Home section, Welcome tab
- `#projects/opportunities?city=atlanta&filter=innovation_bonds` - Projects with filters
- `#people/teams?search=react` - People section with search term
- `#account/preferences` - Account preferences

#### Navigation Methods
- Click navigation elements to update URL automatically
- Use `router.navigate(section, tab, params)` programmatically
- Use `router.setParam(key, value)` to update individual parameters
- Parameters automatically applied to filters and search inputs

#### HashRouter Features
1. **Automatic Validation**: Invalid sections/tabs default to valid alternatives
2. **Parameter Persistence**: Moving from `#home/dashboard?city=Atlanta` to `#people` becomes `#people/people?city=Atlanta`
3. **Filter Synchronization**: URL parameters automatically populate form filters
4. **Browser Integration**: Full browser back/forward button support
5. **Bookmarkable URLs**: Any application state can be bookmarked and shared

#### Supported URL Parameters
- `city`: Filter by location (atlanta, portland, detroit, remote)
- `search`: Search term for projects or people
- `filter`: Project filter (all, opportunities, job_openings, innovation_bonds, high_priority)
- `skill`: Filter by technical skill
- `experience`: Filter by experience level

#### Implementation Notes
- HashRouter is initialized on DOM load and handles all navigation automatically
- Existing navigation event handlers updated to use `router.navigate()` instead of direct DOM manipulation
- Filter changes trigger URL updates with 500ms debounce for search inputs
- All application state syncs with URL parameters for consistent user experience

### Database Schema
Complete CRM schema based on SuiteCRM/Salesforce structure:
- Core entities: users, accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, projects
- Support entities: campaigns, documents, events, products, roles, calls
- Survey system: surveys, surveyquestionoptions, surveyquestionresponses
- Relationship tables for many-to-many associations
- All tables use UUID primary keys and include audit fields

## Setup Process Improvements

### Environment Configuration
1. **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (Azure/Google compatible)
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sqladmin@model-earth-server.database.windows.net/ModelEarthDB
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
   SERVER_PORT=8081
   ```

2. **Fallback Handling**: When database connection fails, populate with informative placeholders rather than errors

3. **Security**: Store auth keys in separate config file excluded by `.gitignore`

### Frontend Setup Requirements
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8081/api'; // Backend URL
```

### Web Server Configuration
The frontend can be served in two different configurations:

1. **Direct Repo Serving**: Web server points directly to the MemberCommons repository root
   - URLs: `http://localhost:8888/admin/import-data.html`
   - File paths: `preferences/projects/DFC-ActiveProjects.xlsx`

2. **Webroot Container**: Repository is placed inside a webroot folder
   - URLs: `http://localhost:8887/membercommons/admin/import-data.html`
   - File paths: `membercommons/preferences/projects/DFC-ActiveProjects.xlsx`
   - Browser relative paths: `../preferences/projects/DFC-ActiveProjects.xlsx`

Webroot Container (port 8887) is prefered since other repos can then reside in the same webroot.

The Rust backend (port 8081) always expects paths relative to the repository root, regardless of web server configuration. Frontend code should convert browser-relative paths (with `../`) to repo-relative paths when making API calls.

- Managers can promote users to manager/editor roles
- No separate members/managers tables needed

### AI Integration Points
1. **Smart Insights**: Analyze account/contact relationships, suggest next steps
2. **Natural Language Search**: Conversational contact queries
3. **Data Analysis**: Generate summaries and recommendations

### Survey System
- Policy preferences: 20 "hot topics" with 5-point Likert scale
- Interest ratings: 20 categories with 5-star ratings (Agriculture, Climate Resilience, etc.)
- Sankey charts showing response correlations (green=positive, mauve=negative)
- Location, age, and demographic data collection

## Submodules and Sample Code

### Submodules (Do Not Document Unless Specifically Referenced)
- **localhost/**: Submodule containing occasional sample code for local development
- **planet/**: Submodule containing occasional sample code and examples

**Important**: These submodules are not part of the main MemberCommons application and should not be documented or investigated by the CLI unless specific processes and files within them are explicitly referenced in the prompt. They contain sample code that may be used for reference but are not part of the core application functionality.
